# InternetOfThings-3D-Printing-Validator

This Verilog program takes a set of 2 3D points(starting and ending points of the movement of the nozzle of the 3D printer) for the entire 3D printing session. It then gives output as 1 for all 3D lines formed by the input that intersect.

This project was done as a part of CSE590 - Computer Architecture. Report and Program is attached.
