# InternetOfThings-3D-Printing-Validator

This Verilog program takes a set of 2 3D points(starting and ending points of the movement of the nozzle of the 3D printer) for the entire 3D printing session. It then gives output as 1 for all 3D lines formed by the input that intersect.

Input is given in the format - x1,y1,z1 and x2, y2, z2 in a text file called gocode.txt. The malicious lines are printed in a file called result.txt.

This project was done as a part of CSE590 - Computer Architecture. Project Report and Program is attached.
